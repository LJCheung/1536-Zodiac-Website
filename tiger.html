        <h3>Strengths of a Tiger </h3>
        <p>They are strong-willed. Once they make up their minds, they will not change it easily. They will never regret what they have said. They are born with stateliness and confidence, so they always impress people with an image of power and authority. They are frank in personality, willing to speak out their feelings so they can gain others’ trust easily. They have difficulty accepting failures so they push themselves quite hard to succeed. Full of sense of fairness and justice, they are very capable to straighten out others’ problems warm-heartedly.</p>
        <h3>Weaknesses of a Tiger</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, people with Chinese zodiac sign of Tiger may go to extremes - they are either too silent or too talkative. They are over confident in their capability which makes it difficult to do well in team work situations. If their thoughts get rejected, they will realize it in an aggressive way. They are anxious to achieve quick successes and get instant benefits but they are usually frustrated by failures. They love to win, so they tend to argue with people, even on trifles. They lack romance in relationship and like to control all affairs of the family, so their married life can be mundane. With strong self-egoism, they find it hard to make some true friends.</p>
