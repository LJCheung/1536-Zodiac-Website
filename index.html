        <h1>The Story of the Chinese Zodiac</h1>
		<!-- Source https://www.topmarks.co.uk/ChineseNewYear/ZodiacStory.aspx -->
		<p>
			Long ago, in China, the Jade Emperor decided there should be a way of measuring time. On his birthday he told the animals
			that there was to be a swimming race. The first twelve animals across the fast flowing river would be the winners and 
			they would each have a year of the zodiac named after them.
		</p>
		<p>
			All the animals lined up along the river bank.
			The rat and the cat, who were good friends, were worried because they 
			were poor swimmers. Being clever they asked the strong ox if he would carry them across the river.
			'Of course' said the kind ox. 'Just climb on my back and I will take you across.'
			The rat and the cat jumped up and were very excited when the ox took the lead.
			They had almost reached the other bank when the rat pushed the cat into the water leaving him to struggle.
			Just as the ox was about to win the race, the rat leapt on his head and on to the
			bank to finish first.
			Well done,' said the Jade Emperor to the proud rat. 'The first year of the zodiac will be named after you.'
			The poor ox had been tricked into second place and the second year of the zodiac was named after him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Shortly after, the exhausted tiger clawed his way to the river bank to claim third place. Swimming across 
			the river had been an enormous struggle for him against the strong currents. The Emperor was so delighted
			with his efforts that he named the third year after him.
			Next to arrive was the rabbit, who hadn't swum across at all. He had hopped across on some stepping stones and
			then found a floating log which carried him to the shore.
			'I shall be very happy to call the fourth year after you,' the surprised Jade Emperor explained.
			Just then a kind dragon swooped down to take fifth place. The Jade Emperor asked, 'Why didn’t you win the race, when you can fly?'
			'I needed to make some rain, because some people and animals needed water to drink,' the 
			dragon explained. 'Then I saw a little rabbit on a log in the water and I 
			blew a puff of wind so that the log would float to the river bank.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next thing the Jade Emperor heard was the sound of the horse’s hooves. Just as he was thinking the horse
			would be the next animal to arrive, a sneaky snake wriggled out from around one of the horse’s hooves.
			The horse was so surprised that he jumped backwards giving the snake a chance to take the sixth place in the race.
			The poor horse had to be satisfied with seventh place.
			Not long afterwards a raft arrived carrying the goat, the monkey and the rooster. They explained to the Emperor how
			they had shared the raft that the rooster had found. The goat and monkey had cleared weeds and pushed the raft to 
			the shore.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next animal to finish was the dog.
			'Why are you so late when you are one of the best swimmers?' asked the Jade Emperor.
			'The water in the river was so clean that I had to have a bath on the way,' explained the dog.
			His reward was to have the eleventh year named after him.
			There was one place left in the zodiac and the Emperor wondered when the last winner would come.
		</p>
		<p>		
			Finally he heard a grunt from the pig.
			'You took a long time to cross the river,' said the Emperor to the pig.
			'I was hungry and stopped to eat,' explained the pig. 'After the meal I felt so tired that I fell asleep.'
			'You have still done well,' said the Jade Emperor. 'The last year of the zodiac will be named after you.'
			From that day to now, the Chinese Zodiac has followed this cycle of years named after these twelve animals.
