Completed:
- all requirements completed

Not Completed:
- N/A


Challenges:
- POSITIONING (especially with the navigation bar and the zodiac buttons on the 12signs.html page)
- Contact Us Form, It took a while to realize that the 'name' was being submitted not the 'id'.
- Quality of the zodiac story, there are many different versions of the zodiac story however not all good stories. Trying to find the original race story was a challenge and I was only able to find something close to it.
- Working on the assignment at the same time remotely proved to be challenging
